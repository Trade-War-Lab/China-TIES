# China-TIES

The Chinese Economic Sanctions (CES v.1) dataset version 1 (aka China TIES) includes 135 episodes where China is the sender and 88+ episodes where it is the target from 1949-2020. 

We use the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions dataset (TIES v.4) as a baseline for identifying and coding sanctions episodes and provide a set of standardized narratives documenting each episode with secondary sources. CES v.1 amends, updates, and cross-reference China-related episodes in widely used sanctions data sources such as EUSANCT and GSDB v.2 in addition to TIES. The result is a dataset that is interoperable with TIES but also contains new CES variables that better capture the informal nature of many Chinese sanctions. Over 70% of our cases were not captured by the existing datasets. We gratefully acknowledge financial support through the Minerva Research Initiative (FA9550-21-1-0143).
